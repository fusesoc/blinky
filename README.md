LED to believe
==============

This project aims to provide LED blinking examples for all the FPGA dev boards in the world.

The goal is to provide a quick way to test your new FPGA board and get acquainted with using [FuseSoC](https://github.com/olofk/fusesoc) in your design flow.

Each FPGA board is implemented as a separate FuseSoC target and users are highly encouraged to add support for their any board at their disposal so that we can have a large collection.

How to use
----------

This project is available in the [FuseSoC base library](https://github.com/fusesoc/fusesoc-cores), so if you have FuseSoC installed, you likely already have this project as well.

To check if it's available run `fusesoc list-cores` and check for a core called `fusesoc:utils:blinky`.

If it's not there, try to run `fusesoc library update` to refresh the core libraries and look again.

If it's still not there, or if you want to modify the project, e.g. to add support for an additional board, you can add LED to believe as a new core library.

Clone the repo somewhere `git clone https://github.com/fusesoc/blinky`.

Create an empty workspace directory somewhere and navigate there.

In your workspace directory, either run `fusesoc library add blinky /path/to/repo` to have it available when running from this workspace, or `fusesoc library add --global blinky /path/to/repo` to have it available in all workspaces

If you just want to have it available temporarily, run with `--cores-root=/path/to/repo ...` as the first argument to FuseSoC

To build for your particular board, run `fusesoc run --target=<board> fusesoc:utils:blinky` where `<board>` is one of the boards listed in the Board support section below.

Alternatively, run `fusesoc core-info fusesoc:utils:blinky` to find all available targets.

There is also a simulation target available to test the core without any hardware. To use this, run `fusesoc run --target=sim fusesoc:utils:blinky`.

The simulation target has a number of target-specific configuration parameters that can be set. All target-specific parameters goes on the end of the command line (after the core name).

To list all simulation parameters, run `fusesoc run --target=sim fusesoc:utils:blinky --help`.

*Example:* To run four pulses with a simulated clock frequency of 4MHz and creating a VCD file, run `fusesoc run --target=sim fusesoc:utils:blinky --pulses=4 --clk_freq_hz=4000000 --vcd`.

The default simulator to use is Icarus Verilog, but other simulators can be used by setting the `--tool` parameter after the `run` command.

Currently supported simulators for this target are icarus, modelsim and xsim. To use e.g. modelsim run `fusesoc run --target=sim --tool=modelsim fusesoc:utils:blinky`.
